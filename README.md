# Design-builder

*Archived April 25. 2023. Outdated*

This is a tool for building __frontend design__. It can be used in an existing larger solution or as a standalone [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) e.g.

## Dependencies

The builder is powered by [Eleventy: github.com/11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy)

# Setup

## Clone this repository to your existing solution

````bash
npx degit ronnidc/design-builder design
cd design
npm i
````

-	By using `degit` instead of `git clone` you get a clean copy without a *.git* history.

	Feel free to name the '__design__' directory something else that fits your solution better.
